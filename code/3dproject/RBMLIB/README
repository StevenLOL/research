HI OAK, please run bimodal.m

I tried it today and it runs without error

the weights for rbms are already pretrained with DBN
They are saved in 'rbm1.mat', 'rbm2.mat', and 'secondLayerRBM.mat'

the inputs (randomly sampled HOG and SIFT features) are already 
saved in 'allFeatures1.mat' and 'allFeatures2.mat'

i'm not sure about computing the delta4, and delta1 and delta2
delta3 comes up to be all 0's because W3 is extremely negative values

thanks a lot
